					Rehabilitation for the handicapped is a big issue in today's world. While existing solutions are functional, they are generally controlled by cables, switches & actuated by motors. This was the motivation behind developing a prototype for a low cost robotic prosthetic arm that is more hassle free and more intuitive to control. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A high precision EMG sensor module was developed to sense the activation of the muscle in the forearm to detect the motion of each finger.  The values of the EMG sensor were processed in real time to send control signal to the robotic arm to replicate the action. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The Project was judged as the <b>Runner-up in Anveshan-2014</b>, design fellowship program organised by Analog Devices, India. A cash Price of Rs.1,50,000.00 was awarded for the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are currently improving the design to develop it into a product.

		<h3>2. Drone</h3>
			<div class="col-lg-8">
				<p>
					The quadcopter is a Drone which uses two pairs of propellers, each in a direction opposite to the other, to achieve flight. Control of vehicle motion is achieved by altering the rotation rate of one or more rotor discs, thereby changing its torque load and thrust/lift characteristics. These vehicles use an electronic control system and electronic sensors to stabilize the aircraft. With their small size and agile manoeuvrability, these quadcopters can be flown indoors as well as outdoors. Thus the device can be used for purposes ranging from reconnaissance to support drops, Aerial surveillance, enemy territory reconnaissance etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently we are working on developing a autonomous quadcopter for aerial surveillance and photography.

					This is a six legged robot meant to traverse rugged terrains. It is a robot whose locomotion is inspired by the cockroach. It is designed keeping in mind that "legs" provide mobility in a wider variety of terrains than wheels or tracks can.  It has been observed that with legged locomotion, any missteps or obstacles affect the performance minimally in addition to different types of locomotion possible with the same hardware.
				</p>
				<p>
					The six legged robot design is inspired from the Rhex, developed by Boston Dynamics, a well known robotics company acquired by Google. We are currently working on the land surveillance in rugged terrain, and working on making it an autonomous robot for a field operation.

		<h3>4. Autonomous Robots</h3>
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<p>
					A robot is supposed to be a "Servant", which does a job when it is told without any questions.  Therefore, the "Servant" should have some degree of autonomy to carry out its tasks. At its most basic level, giving a robot autonomy would imply that it can move around an area independently and efficiently to go about doing its tasks.
				</p>
				<p>
					These aspects are tackled in our Line follower robots, which are popular as robots for beginners. This is because they act as a stepping stone for navigation and tracking applications and also applications of control mechanisms. Grid solvers and path finder act as extensions to the basic line follower model and incorporate the "autonomy" we desire.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are proud to say we have our basics down pat and as a testament to this, we have won 3rd place in <b>Semi-Autonomous Robotics Challenge</b> organised by <b>IIT Madras</b> in January 2015. A cash prize of Rs.10,000.00 was awarded.
				</p>
				<p>
					We were placed 10th position in <b>International Robotics Challenge</b>, organised by <b>IIT Bombay</b> in January 2015.

					LEDs are the most basic element that one is going to use when he starts meddling with as a beginner in electronics. Yet, the fascinating thing that it can do has no bounds. From a simple traffic light to a Ultra HD TV, everything has LEDs in them. We just started meddling around some of the basic things that can be done using LEDs.
